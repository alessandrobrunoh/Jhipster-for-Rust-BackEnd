# GPT AI Agent Context

This folder is reserved for OpenAI GPT (ChatGPT) assistant context and project-specific instructions.

## Purpose

Use this directory to store:
- Project-specific prompts for GPT models
- Context files that help GPT understand your codebase
- Custom instructions for code generation
- Architecture documentation for AI assistance
- GPT-specific configurations and system prompts

## Usage

You can add files here such as:
- `project-context.md` - Overview of the project structure and conventions
- `coding-standards.md` - Your team's coding guidelines
- `prompts/` - Directory for reusable prompts
- `system-prompts.md` - Custom system prompts for GPT
- `examples/` - Code examples for reference

## Example Structure

```
.gpt/
├── README.md (this file)
├── project-context.md
├── architecture.md
├── coding-standards.md
├── system-prompts.md
└── prompts/
    ├── feature-template.md
    ├── refactoring-guide.md
    └── testing-template.md
```

## Tips

- Keep context files concise and well-organized
- Update documentation as the project evolves
- Use markdown format for better readability
- Include relevant code snippets and examples
- Reference specific file paths when needed
- Use clear and specific language in prompts

## GPT-Specific Features

- GPT excels at understanding natural language instructions
- Provide clear context about the project's domain
- Include examples of desired output format
- Specify testing requirements and frameworks
- Define code style and naming conventions
- Use system prompts for consistent behavior

## Custom GPTs

If you're using custom GPTs or GPT Builder:
- Store your GPT configuration here
- Include knowledge base files
- Document custom actions and integrations
- Keep API schemas and documentation
